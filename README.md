3. **Geographical Location Component:** This feature, when implemented, allows users to visualize geographical data. Please note that the specific details of this component may vary based on your location.

4. **Custom Gradient Icon/Table:**
   - Clicking on the gradient icon reveals a custom table feature built with MUI.
